<p>The Master of Logic allows students to earn up to 24 EC via research
projects. These are the research projects I have worked on so far.</p>

<h2 id="formal-analysis-of-material-dialogues-for-fol">Formal Analysis of Material Dialogues for FOL</h2>
<p>This project was supervised by <a href="https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~kirst/">Dominik
Kirst</a> from Saarland University. It can be
viewed as me carrying out one of the ideas mentioned in the &ldquo;future work&rdquo;
section of my <a href="/thesis">Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis</a>. Dialogical logic, originally put forward by
Paul Lorenzen, captures the notion of first-order validity in terms of games
modeled after a debate. Material dialogues, the variant we examine in this
project, has a distinctly model-theoretic flavor compared to the formal
dialogues usually considered in the literature. Arguably, it also is closer to
Lorenzen&rsquo;s original formulation of dialogical logic.</p>
<p>In the course of the project, I gave a novel formalization of material dialogues, using
insights from my Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis. I examined the thereby arising semantics for
first-order logic in the calculus of inductive constructions, with special
attention paid to the constructivity of completeness proofs with regards to
them. I obtained the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical material dialogues admit a soundness proof with regards to a
cut-free sequent calculus. Their induced notion of validity entails exploding
classical Tarski validity, a constructively stricter notion than the usual
Tarski validity. This yields a constructive completeness proof with regards to
a natural deduction system.</li>
<li>Intuitionistic material dialogues admit no completeness proof without
additional assumptions, as their induced notion of validity is entailed by the
standard Tarski validity over a non-trivial fragment of first-order logic.
This means intuitionistic material dialogues &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; parts of the
meta-logic, thus requiring axioms fixing the strength of the meta-logic to
prove completeness.</li>
<li>I give a novel variant of material dialogues for intuitionistic logic, called
Kripke material dialogues, arising from the idea of &ldquo;dialogues played over the
canonical notion of model&rdquo;. Similarly to classical material dialogues for
classical first-order logic, these admit a soundness proof with regards to a cut-free
sequent calculus and a constructive completeness proof with regards to a
natural deduction system, both for intuitionistic first-order logic. However,
the completeness proof is restricted to the ∀,→,⊥-fragment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently in the process of turning the project&rsquo;s results into a paper
which we hope to present at a conference.</p>

<h2 id="aczels-type-theoretic-interpretation-of-czf">Aczel&rsquo;s Type-Theoretic Interpretation of CZF</h2>
<p>This project was supervised by <a href="https://www.robertpassmann.eu/">Robert
Passmann</a>. It can be viewed as a culmination of
the set theory lectures which I took during the Master of Logic and my
background in type theory. I read Peter Aczel&rsquo;s three seminal papers on his
interpretation of constructive Zeremelo-Fraenkel set theory into Martin Löf&rsquo;s
dependent type theory and summarized them in a manner accessible to anyone with
a little knowledge about axiomatic set theory and no background in type theory.</p>
<p>The summary was published as part of the ILLC technical report series. I also
gave a talk on the subject at the Mathematische Logik research seminar at
Hamburg university on the 21. January 2021.</p>

<h2 id="categorical-normalization-by-evaluation">Categorical Normalization by Evaluation</h2>
<p>This project was supervised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.vandenberg3/">Benno van den
Berg</a>. We read papers on
normalization by evaluation, a semantic technique for normalizing the terms of a
type theory. The focus was on papers which made use of categorical semantics (see
the references below). To close the project, I combined the insights gleamed
from the reading to try to transfer a technique for handling certain additional
constants, introduced in the seminal paper on NBE by Berger and Schwichtenberg,
to the categorical setting of the reduction free normalization proof of
Altenkirch et. al. I succeeded in adapting the categorical normalization
interpretation from Altenkirch et. al. to admit Schwichtenberg&rsquo;s and Berger&rsquo;s
inductive correctness proof of the normalization theorem with the added
constants. However, I did not manage to extend the categorical proof of the
normalization theorem, given by Altenkirch et. al., to cover generic constants
with similar conditions.</p>
